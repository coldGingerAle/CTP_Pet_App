# CTP_Pet_App
CTP project

Our idea is a website with an interactive map that allows users to report incidents and emergencies regarding animals such as, lost animals, found animals, or animals up for adoption. Users can report animal emergencies real time(similar to how one can report crime with the Citizen app, or traffic with the Waze app); the app will automatically notify other users, animal owners, vets, animal hospitals, etc within a defined area. Users with the app online would receive push notifications when an incident is posted. We are also interested in having an interface that helps you find top rated vets in the area (similar to how the app Zocdoc works).
